Welcome to my personal page, I am a software engineer interested in creating well-engineered and human web experiences. Some of the technologies I use to achieve this are:
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)

Beyond these technologies, I am also interested in the following approaches to software engineering and development...
* Agile
* SCRUM
* Behaviour-Driven Development
* Domain-Driven Design

I might also ramble sometimes about philosophy, politics and music. I can easily be found at live music gigs and festivals or at [Crossfit Digbeth](https://www.crossfitdigbeth.com/).

Currently living in [Birmingham](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Birmingham,+United+Kingdom/) and working at [Shell Energy](https://www.shellenergy.co.uk/).
