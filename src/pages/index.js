    <h2>Oh, I think we should just stay friends.</h2>
    <p>Large bet on myself in round one. I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?</p>
    <p>Okay, I like a challenge. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? <strong> File not found.</strong> <em> Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?</em> No, just a regular mistake.</p>
    <h2>Hey, guess what you're accessories to.</h2>
    <p>I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.</li><li>Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.</li><li>Hello, little man. I will destroy you!</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!</h3>
    <p>And I'm his friend Jesus. With gusto. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Really?!</li><li>You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?</li><li>That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Daylight and everything. You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!</p>
    <p>Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! You are the last hope of the universe. Daylight and everything. I can explain. It's very valuable.</p>
    <p>OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Tell them I hate them. Oh right. I forgot about the battle. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!</p>
    <p>Tell her she looks thin. No. We're on the top. No! Don't jump! There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.</p>
    <p>Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Meh. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried?</p>
    <p>Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! You're going to do his laundry? Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! File not found. Bender?! You stole the atom.</p>
    <p>My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. They're like sex, except I'm having them!</p>
    <p>Bite my shiny metal ass. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. Can we have Bender Burgers again? Bender?! You stole the atom.</p>
    <p>Bender, we're trying our best. I'm sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in. Soothe us with sweet lies. And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.</p>
    <p>Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!</p>
    <p>I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. We're rescuing ya. And I'd do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. Who are you, my warranty?!</p>
