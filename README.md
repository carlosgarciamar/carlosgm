# carlosgm

Repo for my very own site, very early development. Created with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com).

Commits to master are automatically deployed into production:\
https://www.carlosgm.com | https://www.carlosgm.es

## Run me

Create a `.env.development` with the following:

```
GATSBY_LANGUAGE=en
```

Languages supported: `en` / `es`

`yarn` - Install the dependencies\
`yarn start` - Build stuff

## Host me

Create a `GATSBY_LANGUAGE` OS env variable with value `en` or `es`.

`yarn build` - Build all static resources\
`yarn serve` - Serve the stuff that you built

## TO-DO:

-   Finish multilanguage support
-   Finish SEO and optimisations
-   Add some more strict linting and prettier rules
-   Write more content
-   Add social media

Some ideas...

-   Light/Dark theme support
-   Comments
